The objective of this task is to utilize a machine learning model for predicting Boston housing prices. To begin, I loaded the dataset into a Jupyter notebook using the pandas library.
 Next, I conducted data cleaning to handle any missing values and appropriately organized the columns. In the data cleaning process, I checked for any outliers, duplicates, or inconsistencies that could affect the model's performance.
After this preprocessing step, I proceeded to train the machine learning model using linear regression.  To evaluate the trained linear regression model, I employed various performance metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared. These metrics allowed to gauge how well the model captured the underlying patterns in the data and how accurately it could predict Boston housing prices.
To enhance the model's performance, we explored feature engineering techniques, extracting new 
To gain insights into the model's predictions, I visualized the results, such as plotting the predicted housing prices against the actual prices to observe any patterns or deviations. This helped identify potential areas for improvement and fine-tuning.
In conclusion, the entire process of loading, cleaning, training, and evaluating the machine learning model was meticulously executed to create a reliable and accurate predictor for Boston housing prices. The iterative nature of machine learning allowed us to continually refine and optimize the model until we obtained desirable results.
