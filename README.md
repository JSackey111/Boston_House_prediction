# Boston_House_prediction
The main goal of this task is to use a machine learning model to predict housing prices in Boston. Initially, the dataset was loaded into a Jupyter notebook using the pandas library. I performed data cleaning process to handle missing values and appropriately organize the columns. Outliers, duplicates, and inconsistencies were also addressed to ensure the model's performance is not compromised.
After this preprocessing step, I proceeded to train the machine learning model using linear regression.  
In the end, the complete pipeline, including loading, cleaning, training, and evaluating the machine learning model, was carefully executed to create a dependable and accurate predictor for Boston housing prices.
